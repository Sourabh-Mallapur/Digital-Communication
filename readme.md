## Design and Simulation of Modulation Techniques and Signal Reconstruction Methods in Python and Matlab
Implementation of a Double Sideband Suppressed Carrier (DSBSC) modulation and demodulation system using Python.
Leveraging a product modulator for generating the DSBSC signal and a coherent demodulator for accurately retrieving the original message signal from the modulated wave.
